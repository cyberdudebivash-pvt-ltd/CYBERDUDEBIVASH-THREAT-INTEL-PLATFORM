"""
Regression tests for issue #274: api/ai/{tracker,health,executive-brief,
monetization}.json moved off git entirely, onto R2 (owner decision, via
AskUserQuestion).

Root cause (from #274's investigation): generate-and-sync.yml's
`git push origin main` for these files has been failing on every scheduled
run since main started requiring PRs, silently (continue-on-error), freezing
whatever copy was committed before that. Meanwhile the real serving path --
R2, uploaded independently by both sentinel-blogger.yml's r2_upload.py and
generate-and-sync.yml's own STAGE 9.5 -- kept updating, but the Worker's
/api/ai/{filename} handler only ever checked a gh-pages raw-GitHub fallback,
never the R2 bucket both pipelines were already populating.

Fix: the Worker now checks R2 first (falls back to gh-pages only if the R2
object is missing); these 4 files are no longer git-tracked or staged for
commit; a dead KV-cache-bust call (busting cache keys that were never in the
endpoint's own allowlist, so always got HTTP 400) was removed alongside it.

Run with: pytest tests/test_ai_tracker_off_git.py -v
