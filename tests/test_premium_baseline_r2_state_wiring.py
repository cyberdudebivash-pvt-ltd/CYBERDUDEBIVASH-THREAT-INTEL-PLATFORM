"""F26 (2026-10-02): sentinel-blogger.yml carries api/feed.baseline.json
between runs through R2, around STAGE 3.1.19 only.

The baseline was persisted only by STAGE 4's git push, refused since
2026-08-26, so every run read the 26 August copy back and the four
Enterprise/MSSP premium feeds built from it served August items. These tests
pin the replacement:
  * the explicit R2 download runs before the baseline engine;
  * the engine reports whether it wrote a new baseline;
  * the upload runs after the engine and before the tiered feed generator
    reads the baseline;
  * the upload is skipped unless the run started from R2's copy (or R2 had
    none yet) and the engine wrote a new baseline;
  * no broad state sweep moves the file.
