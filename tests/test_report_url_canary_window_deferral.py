tests/test_report_url_canary_window_deferral.py

P0 regression coverage for scripts/report_url_canary.py's --local gate
(STAGE 5.8.1b) root-cause fix.

CONFIRMED PRODUCTION FAILURE: sentinel-blogger.yml run #2250 -- the same
natural production run whose STAGE 3.3 and STAGE 5.4.1 gates both passed
cleanly for the first time (after PRs #375/#376 fixed the identical
architectural mismatch in scripts/validate_reports.py and
scripts/report_existence_validator.py), and which then went on to succeed
at STAGE 5 (Deploy to GitHub Pages) -- progressed one stage further and
hard-failed at STAGE 5.8.1b instead:
  "LOCAL GATE: 214 ok / 184 missing / 0 invalid (of 398)"
  "P0 FAIL-CLOSED: 184 report_url(s) would publish without a valid artifact."

This is the exact same rolling-window mismatch already fixed twice in this
codebase, in a THIRD, previously-unfixed sibling gate: PR #369 bounded
report (re)generation to a rolling REPORT_WINDOW_HOURS window, and reports/
is gitignored (never persisted across CI runs), so a fresh runner has zero
local file for a CURRENT-feed report_url whose id was rendered/published in
an earlier run and is still legitimately current (in-window, or already
durably published to R2 per r2_report_publisher.py's own state) but wasn't
re-rendered THIS run.

These tests reproduce that scenario at both the local_artifact_check() unit
level and the --local main() end-to-end level, and prove: a genuinely
missing IN-WINDOW report still hard-fails (the gate's real safety
guarantee -- catching a report this run was actually responsible for
producing but didn't), while an out-of-window or confirmed-durably-
published missing report is deferred, not failed. A body-invalid
(soft-404) artifact is never deferred regardless of age, and a report_url
with no recoverable item metadata (deployment_manifest.json fallback path)
is conservatively never deferred either.

Tests use only local temp files -- no real R2/network access.
