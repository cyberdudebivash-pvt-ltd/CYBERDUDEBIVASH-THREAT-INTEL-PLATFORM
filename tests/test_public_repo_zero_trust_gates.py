P0 (2026-09-10): SENTINEL APEX Public-Repo Zero-Trust Architecture, phase 1.

This repository is deliberately public (the GitHub Actions minutes quota is
a real production cost constraint), so the working security model is not
"hide the source" -- it is "assume every public file is already known to an
attacker; production must stay secure anyway." Two specific, mechanically
checkable pieces of that model regressed silently once already before this
commit and would again without a test:

1. Every third-party GitHub Action referenced from this repo's workflows
   was pinned to a floating tag (`@v6.0.2`, `@v5`, `@v4`, ...) rather than
   an immutable commit SHA -- a supply-chain risk this exact codebase has
   already had to fix twice for one single action (see
   sast-security-scan.yml's TruffleHog step history: floating @main ->
   version tag -> SHA, three separate incidents for one line). Fixed
   repo-wide in this commit (187 references across 63 workflow files,
   each resolved via `git ls-remote` against the action's real repository,
   not guessed) -- this test is what stops any of them, or a new workflow
   added later, from silently drifting back to a mutable tag.

2. `pull_request_target` combined with untrusted checkout is a well-known
   GitHub Actions injection vector (a fork PR's workflow run gets the base
   repo's secrets). This repository has never used that trigger -- this
   test pins that absence so it can't be introduced unnoticed in a future
   workflow, rather than relying on it staying true by accident.

Phase 2 (2026-09-10) added a third:

3. GITHUB_TOKEN write permissions. A repo-wide audit (see
   config/workflow_permissions_allowlist.json) found every workflow that
   requests a write scope, verified each against the actual git/API
   commands in that specific job (not assumed), and narrowed several from
   workflow-wide grants to the one job that genuinely needs them --
   including removing three permissions (deployments: write on
   enterprise-rollback-governance.yml, security-events: write on
   sbom-generation.yml, actions: write on automated-backup.yml) that were
   granted but never used by any step anywhere in those files. Every
   (workflow, job, permission) triple that currently resolves to a write
   scope must have a matching entry in that allowlist; a write permission
   introduced anywhere without one fails this test, rather than silently
   expanding what a compromised job in this public repo could do.

Phase 3 (2026-09-10) added a fourth, over application code rather than
workflow YAML -- authenticated CORS / cross-origin trust-boundary hardening:

4. `workers/intel-gateway/src/index.js` used to spread a single constant,
   `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: "*"`, into essentially every response the
   Worker returns (via CORS_HEADERS/withBaselineHeaders()), and 13 other
   files independently duplicated the identical literal -- including
   admin (`/api/admin/*`), the $49/report premium endpoint, and customer
   billing/quota 402 responses. cors-policy.js is now the single source of
   truth (see its own header comment for the full route-classification
   model); every genuinely public exception is recorded in
   config/cors_public_wildcard_allowlist.json with a route, file, trust
   classification, reason, data-sensitivity note, and
   mutation_capability=false, exactly mirroring how Phase 2's write-
   permission allowlist works above. This test is what stops a future
   change from silently reintroducing a wildcard (or an Origin-reflecting
   duplicate policy) anywhere else in that Worker.

All checks are read-only, mechanical, and evidence-based against the
actual `.github/workflows/*.yml` files (Phases 1-2) or
`workers/intel-gateway/src/*.js` files (Phase 3) -- not a hand-maintained
list that itself could drift out of sync with what's real.
