Regression test for a P0 defect in scripts/python_governance_immunity_engine.py
(STAGE 0.06b of sentinel-blogger.yml): the SMART_QUOTES dict's literal
Unicode key characters (U+2018/U+2019/U+201C/U+201D) had been silently
collapsed to plain ASCII apostrophe/quote by some earlier normalization
pass over this file. Confirmed live via runtime introspection before the
fix: SMART_QUOTES had only 6 entries instead of 8, the U+2018/U+2019
entries had both collapsed to a no-op "'" -> "'" self-map (a Python dict
literal keeps only the last of duplicate keys), and the U+201C/U+201D
entries were gone entirely (their source text was three consecutive
double-quote characters, which got re-parsed as a Python triple-quoted
string spanning both lines instead of two separate one-character dict
keys).

Impact: every ordinary ASCII apostrophe in every scanned script -- e.g.
scripts/report_generator.py's single-quoted HTML string literals -- was
misreported as a "smart/curly quote", while real curly double quotes
(U+201C/U+201D) went completely undetected. Confirmed via live GitHub
Actions job logs (run predating this fix): dozens of
"Smart/curly quote U+0027 (\"'\") found - replace with \"'\"" WARN findings
for ordinary code across the repo.

Fix: rewrite the dict with explicit \\uXXXX escapes (matching this same
file's own INVISIBLE_CHARS dict, which was never affected because it
already used escapes) so the key characters render as plain ASCII in the
source and cannot be silently mangled by a future encoding-normalization
pass the same way again.

This finding was WARN-severity only (see check_smart_quotes() feeding
result["warnings"], never result["failures"]) so it never hard-failed
STAGE 0.06b -- but it was actively corrupting the tool's diagnostic
output and its ability to catch the real defect it exists for.
