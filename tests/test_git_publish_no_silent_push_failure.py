tests/test_git_publish_no_silent_push_failure.py

Regression test for the P0 root cause of the 2026-08-26 core-feed staleness
incident: both of this platform's automated git-publish paths --
.github/workflows/multi-source-intel.yml's inline "Commit Intel State &
Manifest" step and scripts/safe_git_commit.py (used by sentinel-blogger.yml's
STAGE 4 - Git Sync) -- retry `git push origin main` up to 4 times and then,
on total exhaustion, only logged a bare warning and continued with exit 0.

Confirmed live via GitHub Actions job logs: since main's branch ruleset
started requiring "Changes must be made through a pull request" (~2026-08-26),
every single scheduled run of both workflows has had all 4 push attempts
rejected with "remote: error: GH013: Repository rule violations ... - Changes
must be made through a pull request", yet both jobs kept reporting SUCCESS.
multi-source-intel.yml's true_intel_ingestor.py was genuinely fetching fresh
intelligence (e.g. one run logged "[RSS] Ingestion complete: 95 feeds, 227 new
items, 2234 skipped") but every byte of it was discarded on every run because
it never reached main -- this is why api/feed.json's generated_at stayed
frozen at 2026-08-26T09:55:27Z through Sep 2 despite dozens of "green" runs
of both workflows in between.

Fix:
  - multi-source-intel.yml: this workflow's "Commit Intel State & Manifest"
    step is its last substantive step (no downstream steps in this job
    depend on it), so a fully-exhausted push now hard-fails the job
    (`exit 1` + an `::error::` annotation) instead of silently continuing.
  - safe_git_commit.py: deliberately NOT hard-failed. STAGE 4 sits mid-way
    through sentinel-blogger.yml's 162-stage pipeline, and many downstream
    steps (STAGE 5.6.1 Regression Immunity, STAGE 5.6.2 Stale-Feed
    Recurrence Guard, STAGE 5 Deploy to GitHub Pages, etc.) have no
    `if: always()` guard -- flipping STAGE 4 to "failure" would silently
    skip all of them via GitHub Actions' default `if: success()`, which is
    a worse outcome than today's silent-but-contained warning. Instead this
    now emits a loud `::error::` GitHub Actions annotation (still exits 0),
    matching the same pattern already used one stage later by STAGE 4.1's
    r2_resync_manifests.py failure handling.

Superseded update (see scripts/r2_state_sync.py / tests/test_r2_state_sync.py
/ tests/test_r2_state_migration_wiring.py): multi-source-intel.yml's
"Commit Intel State & Manifest" step no longer attempts a git push at all.
The hard-fail-on-exhaustion behavior above was a genuine improvement over
silent failure, but it was still failing on every single run: main's branch
ruleset rejects ANY direct push to main, not just pushes of specific files,
so once ALL of this step's files were migrated to R2 (feed_state.json /
processed_intel.json / feed_manifest.json / data/feed_manifest.json plus,
found by a later CodeRabbit review, the 5 data/intelligence_repository/*.json
registry files + advisories/), there was nothing left this step could ever
successfully commit -- a push attempt here was structurally guaranteed to
fail, forever, not just historically. TestMultiSourceIntelCommitStepFailsLoudly
below is updated to assert the step no longer attempts a push at all, rather
than asserting how it fails when it does.
