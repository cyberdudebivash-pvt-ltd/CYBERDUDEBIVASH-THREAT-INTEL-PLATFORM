"""F3 (2026-10-02): the freshness guard also runs when frequent workflows complete.

GitHub delivered about 4 of the guard cron's 48 daily slots, so a 4h-old feed
usually reached the 6h breach before the guard looked. intel-freshness-guard.yml
therefore also listens for `workflow_run` completions of the workflows pinned
below. A `workflow_run` trigger names workflows by display name. A name that
no longer matches (a version bump, a rename) silently never fires: F4 found
four such chains. These tests turn that drift into a failure.
