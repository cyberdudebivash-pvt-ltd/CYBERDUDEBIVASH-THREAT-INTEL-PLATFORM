CYBERDUDEBIVASH(R) SENTINEL APEX -- Report Continuity: Canonical Manifest Key Guard

P0.2 INCIDENT (2026-08-22): scripts/field_preserving_merge.py's _load_manifest()
searched a dict-shaped manifest for one of ("data", "items", "entries", "intel")
-- but never "advisories", the canonical envelope key used by every other
manifest reader/writer in the pipeline (validate_reports.py, report_generator.py,
manifest_reconciler.py, report_existence_validator.py, sync_report_urls.py).

Production evidence (run 32570451251, job 97025064853): STAGE 3.1.5 logged
"[merge] Loaded existing manifest: 0 items from feed_manifest.json (fmt=dict)"
against a manifest that actually held 1115 items under "advisories". Because
_load_manifest() couldn't find a recognised key, run_merge() treated the
manifest as empty, merged only the ~500-item incoming api/feed.json batch, and
_atomic_write() -- independently re-deriving a key via the same broken list --
fell through to injecting a brand-new "data" key. The real "advisories" list
was left completely untouched (frozen, stale) while every downstream script
that reads "advisories" first (which is nearly everything) kept operating on
whatever content was there before this step ever ran -- exactly the kind of
inconsistent, unverified carry-forward that produces dangling report_url
entries over time.

This exact symptom class ("field_preserving_merge.py writes under 'data' by
default") is independently documented as a prior incident and defensively
worked around in ioc_quality_hardener.py, validate_reports.py,
report_generator.py, enterprise_scoring_engine.py, and
api_dashboard_contract_validator.py -- but the writer itself was never fixed.

FIX: _load_manifest() now checks "advisories" first (matching the canonical
order used everywhere else) and returns the matched key; _atomic_write() now
requires that exact key instead of independently re-deriving one. Read and
write are now guaranteed to target the same key within a single invocation.

These tests lock in that contract directly against the module's public
functions (run_merge, merge_preserving_fields, sync_apex_ai_from_feed) and via
subprocess against the exact CLI invocations sentinel-blogger.yml's STAGE
3.1.5 and STAGE 3.1.6 now use, so this cannot silently regress.
