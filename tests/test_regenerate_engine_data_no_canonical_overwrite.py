P0 RUNTIME INTELLIGENCE STATE RECOVERY mission follow-up (2026-09-10):
regression guard for the duplicate-writer bug found via this mission's own
required live-production verification. scripts/regenerate_engine_data.py
(run every sentinel-blogger.yml cycle) used to unconditionally recompute
AND WRITE data/{nexus,genesis,cortex,quantum,sovereign}/*_output.json from
its own independent algorithm, stamping one shared module-level NOW_UTC
into every output. Before this mission, that was harmless -- those paths
were gitignored and never uploaded anywhere, so the write was discarded at
the end of every job. The moment this mission registered those same 5
paths in scripts/r2_state_sync.py's STATE_FILES (to give NEXUS/CORTEX/
QUANTUM/SOVEREIGN/GENESIS a real, fresh, R2-persisted canonical producer
via sovereign-platform.yml/genesis-powerhouse.yml), sentinel-blogger.yml's
own PRE-EXISTING, unchanged `r2_state_sync.py --upload` calls (broad, no
--only) started picking up whatever this script last wrote locally and
publishing it to the SAME R2 keys -- a second, differently-computed writer
silently racing and overwriting the canonical one. Confirmed live: a
production curl caught all 5 R2 objects holding one shared, older
generated_at (this module's own NOW_ISO) that had overwritten a
freshly-verified, newer canonical write from genesis-powerhouse.yml
minutes earlier.

Fix: this script no longer writes to those 5 canonical paths (still
computes generate_nexus()/generate_genesis() in-memory, since
generate_engines_api() depends on their return values). This test proves
the 5 paths are never created/touched by main(), while api/engines.json
(which has no other canonical producer and must keep working) still is.
