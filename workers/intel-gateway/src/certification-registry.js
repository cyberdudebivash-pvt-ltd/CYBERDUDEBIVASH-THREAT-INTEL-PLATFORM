/**
 * workers/intel-gateway/src/certification-registry.js
 * Persisted publication-certification state -- P0 trust-boundary fix.
 *
 * PROBLEM (forensic evidence, live production, 2026-08-11): /api/reports/
 * latest.json's publication filter resolved each registry entry against the
 * CURRENT rolling-window feed sources and only ran evaluatePublicationGate()
 * for entries it could resolve there. An entry that had scrolled OUT of that
 * window was "unresolvable" and was passed through UNFILTERED -- so of
 * latest.json's 50 raw candidates, the 33 that WERE resolvable were
 * correctly REJECTED by the gate (P20/P21/P23/P25/P26 all failing --
 * genuinely low-quality, not a miscalibration), while the 17 that "survived"
 * were ALL unresolvable, none of them actually certified. NOT_FOUND_IN_FEED
 * had become a silent CUSTOMER_READY equivalent.
 *
 * FIX: certification is evaluated ONCE per item, at the first opportunity it
 * is resolvable against the rolling feed, and the verdict is PERSISTED here
 * (R2, independent of feed membership). From then on: (a) an item that has
 * already been certified remains verifiable forever, regardless of whether
 * it later scrolls out of the feed -- Section 5's historical-provenance
 * requirement -- and (b) an item that has NEVER been evaluated -- whether
 * because it hasn't been seen yet or because it will never resolve again --
 * is classified NOT_EVALUATED and is NEVER treated as customer-ready. That
 * is the one invariant this module exists to guarantee:
 *
 *   NOT_EVALUATED (including the old "NOT_FOUND_IN_FEED" case) != CUSTOMER_READY
 *
 * evaluatePublicationGate() (publication-gate.js) is reused completely
 * UNCHANGED -- this module only adds persistence and the explicit state-model
 * naming this task's design (Sections 1/3/4) requires around it. No
 * certification engine (P20/P21/P23/P25/P26) is touched, reimplemented, or
 * recalibrated. No secondary scoring logic is introduced.
