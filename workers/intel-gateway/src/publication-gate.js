 * CUSTOMER PUBLICATION AUTHORIZATION GATE  -  P0 incident remediation.
 *
 * INCIDENT: intel--ba996dad34540150b8ea1b5f was publicly served through
 * /reports/** despite P21=4/100 (BELOW_MINIMUM), P25=28% (BELOW THRESHOLD),
 * P26=29/100 (REJECTED), P23=4/10 (INCOMPLETE  -  DO NOT PUBLISH). Root cause,
 * traced (not guessed):
 *
 *   1. The /reports/** route (index.js) never consulted ANY certification
 *      result before serving. It resolves an item (via findItemBySlug or a
 *      direct R2 hit), generates/serves HTML, and caches it  -  the actual
 *      P20-P26 verdicts only ever appeared as DISPLAY content inside the
 *      generated report, never as a gate on whether to serve it at all.
 *   2. The one function that superficially resembles a "release gate"
 *      (p32-handlers.js:_computeReleaseGate, "P32.13") only treats 4 basic
 *      data-completeness checks as blockers (title/description/severity/
 *      CVSS-or-severity present)  -  genuine quality/trust-score failures are
 *      demoted to non-blocking warnings, so it reports PUBLICATION_APPROVED
 *      even when P21/P25/P26/P23 all reject the same item. It was also
 *      never wired into the serving decision anywhere  -  a display block,
 *      not a gate.
 *   3. Pipeline ordering (.github/workflows/sentinel-blogger.yml): STAGE 3.2
 *      (report generation, scripts/report_generator.py) runs BEFORE STAGE
 *      3.93.15d/h/i (P21/P25/P26 certification)  -  confirmed by exact line
 *      numbers in that file. Reports can be generated before certification
 *      has even run.
 *
 * THIS MODULE is the single authoritative publication decision this
 * incident's remediation policy requires: DENY OVERRIDES ALLOW across every
 * existing certification engine, FAIL CLOSED on missing/erroring data, and
 * it reuses the canonical engine functions unchanged (computeP20QualityScore,
 * getP21CertificationLevel, the newly-extracted computeOperationalReadiness,
 * computeEnterpriseTrustScore, computeP26Grade) rather than re-implementing
 * any scoring logic. It does NOT consult P32's release gate at all  -  the
 * most permissive engine must never be allowed to win.
 *
 * SCOPE (documented, not silent): this closes the confirmed, actively
 * exploited path  -  the Worker's /reports/** synthesis + direct R2 serving.
 * It does NOT modify scripts/report_generator.py or
 * scripts/generate_intel_reports.py (the Python-side generators that also
 * write into the same reports/ R2 keyspace, per STAGE 3.6.5's own comment:
 * "no shared ownership model"). Reordering that 50+ stage production
 * pipeline safely requires its own dedicated, carefully-tested change  -  see
 * the incident report's Root Cause / Residual Risk sections.

 * satisfy. Counting that absence as a quality FAILURE conflates
 * "not applicable to this report type" with "missing required content."
 *
 * This does NOT touch computeOperationalReadiness() itself (no shared
 * P23 engine logic changes -- Section 26 forbids silently changing scoring),
 * does NOT lower the 50% threshold, and does NOT apply to VULNERABILITY-type
 * items (a CVE advisory with no CVSS/patch data is still genuinely
 * incomplete). It only changes the DENOMINATOR for non-vulnerability items
 * that carry zero CVE/CVSS/KEV signal at all, by excluding gates that could
