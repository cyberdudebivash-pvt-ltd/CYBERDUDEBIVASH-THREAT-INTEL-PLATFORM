// P0 fix: /api/health's `status: "ok"` has only ever meant "the gateway
// answered a request" -- confirmed live during the 2026-08-26 core-feed
// staleness incident, status:"ok" coexisted with a stats.last_sync roughly
// one week old (production /api/health showed
// last_sync:"2026-08-26T08:50:13Z" while generated_at, the response's own
// timestamp, was 2026-09-02). classifyFreshness() gives /api/health an
// independent freshness signal, so PLATFORM_REACHABLE and DATA_FRESHNESS
// can never be silently conflated into one status field again.
//
// CodeRabbit review finding on this migration (verified and fixed, not
// this test file's concern but noted for context): the handler originally
// passed stats.last_sync (the MAX published/published_at across feed items
// -- source article recency, not sync recency) into classifyFreshness().
// That's a different signal from "when did this platform last successfully
// ingest" -- a broken pipeline whose last successful ingest happened to
// include recently-published source articles would have reported FRESH,
// masking exactly the class of incident this field exists to catch. Fixed
// by passing feedData.generated_at (the pipeline's own "when I last wrote
// this file" timestamp) instead. classifyFreshness() itself is a pure
// function of whatever ISO timestamp it's given, so this test file's own
// coverage is unaffected by which field the caller passes in.
//
// Thresholds match this platform's own known ingestion cadence
// (multi-source-intel.yml + sentinel-blogger.yml both run roughly every 4h):
// FRESH < 6h (tolerates one missed cycle), RECENT < 24h, AGING < 72h,
// STALE >= 72h.
