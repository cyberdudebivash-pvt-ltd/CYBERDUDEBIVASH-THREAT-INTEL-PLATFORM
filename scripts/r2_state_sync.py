CYBERDUDEBIVASH(R) SENTINEL APEX -- Cross-Run Intel State R2 Sync (P0 FIX)
================================================================================
Root cause fixed: main's branch ruleset now requires "Changes must be made
through a pull request", so multi-source-intel.yml's and sentinel-blogger.yml's
direct `git push origin main` for these three files has been rejected on
every scheduled run since ~2026-08-26 -- silently, until the companion fix in
this same effort made both push-exhaustion paths loud (see
tests/test_git_publish_no_silent_push_failure.py). true_intel_ingestor.py was
genuinely fetching fresh intelligence every run (confirmed live: 227 new RSS
items in one run alone) but every byte of the resulting state was discarded
before reaching main, so every run started from the same frozen 2026-08-26
state -- this is the direct mechanism behind api/feed.json's generated_at
staying frozen despite dozens of "green" pipeline runs in between.

Extends the pattern already reviewed and approved for issue #274 / PR #293
(api/ai/{tracker,health,executive-brief,monetization}.json moved off git onto
R2) to the four files true_intel_ingestor.py's and sentinel-blogger.yml's
own pipeline's cross-run state actually depends on:

  data/cache/feed_state.json    -- per-source last_seen timestamps + reason
                                    codes. Read+written every run by
                                    true_intel_ingestor.py; also read by
                                    scripts/source_fabric_health.py (invoked
                                    from sentinel-blogger.yml) and
                                    scripts/intel_dedup_engine.py.
  data/processed_intel.json     -- SHA256 dedup fingerprint store. Read+
                                    written every run by
                                    true_intel_ingestor.py; prevents
                                    reprocessing already-seen items.
  data/stix/feed_manifest.json  -- the raw accumulated intel items. Written
                                    (additive merge) by true_intel_ingestor.py;
                                    read AND further enriched (MITRE tags, IOC
                                    hardening, quality scoring, dedup) by
                                    dozens of call sites throughout
                                    scripts/run_pipeline.py, which is the
                                    Single Source of Truth this file's own
                                    docstring at line 2168 describes it as.
  data/feed_manifest.json       -- the EII-enriched manifest (distinct file,
                                    NOT the same as data/stix/feed_manifest.json
                                    above). Read-then-patched in place by
                                    run_pipeline.py, apex_quality_field_backfill.py,
                                    cve_id_backfill.py, actor_attribution_enricher.py,
                                    generate_advisory_pdfs.py and
                                    threat_graph_engine.py, all within
                                    sentinel-blogger.yml -- and, like the
                                    three files above, one of
                                    safe_git_commit.py's CRITICAL files whose
                                    git push was being silently rejected by
                                    the same root cause.

Unlike issue #274's AI-tracker files (pure output, regenerated fresh every
run, no need to read prior state back in), these four are genuinely
bidirectional cross-run state that multi-source-intel.yml and/or
sentinel-blogger.yml read at the START of their run and write back at the
END -- so this is a download-before/upload-after wrapper around each
workflow's existing processing, not a one-way "stop committing, start
uploading" change. Every consumer above keeps reading/writing the exact same
local file paths it always has; this script's only job is making sure the
freshest cross-workflow copy is sitting at that path before those consumers
run, and that whatever they leave there gets published back to R2 after.

Concurrency note: R2 objects are plain last-write-wins storage, not
transactional. multi-source-intel.yml (cron '45 1,5,9,13,17,21') and
sentinel-blogger.yml (cron '0,4,8,12,16,20') are deliberately staggered by
the workflows' own existing schedule comments specifically to avoid
overlapping writes to this same state -- this script does not add its own
locking on top of that existing mitigation, and does not claim to. If a run
overruns into the next window, last-write-wins is the accepted risk; there
is no stronger coordination primitive available from plain R2 object storage
without introducing a new dependency this fix's scope doesn't justify.

Usage:
  python3 scripts/r2_state_sync.py --download   # run BEFORE ingestion/pipeline
  python3 scripts/r2_state_sync.py --upload     # run AFTER ingestion/pipeline

Environment variables (same names already used by scripts/r2_upload.py):
  CF_ACCOUNT_ID            -- Cloudflare account ID
  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID        -- R2 access key   (mapped from CF_R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID)
  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY    -- R2 secret key   (mapped from CF_R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY)

# Single source of truth for which local paths are R2-authoritative state,
# and what key each lives under.
#
# data/stix/feed_manifest.json MUST use the key "intel/feed_manifest.json" --
# NOT a path-mirrored key -- because scripts/r2_upload.py's STAGE 3.5 upload
# (sentinel-blogger.yml) already publishes this exact file under that exact
# key, every run, and workers/intel-gateway/src/index.js's handleFeedJson
# already reads it from there. Using a different key here would silently
# fork this platform's manifest state into two R2 objects that never see
# each other's writes -- confirmed by reading both the existing upload call
# site and the Worker's read call site, not assumed.
#
# feed_state.json / processed_intel.json have no pre-existing R2 presence
# (confirmed: no reference to either anywhere in r2_upload.py or the Worker),
# so their keys mirror their local relative path, matching this codebase's
# existing convention for genuinely-new R2 objects (e.g. r2_upload.py's
# "api/feed.json" -> R2 key "api/feed.json").
#
# data/feed_manifest.json (top-level -- the EII-enriched manifest, distinct
# from data/stix/feed_manifest.json's raw ingestion bundle) belongs in this
# list for the same reason as the three above: it is bidirectional cross-run
# state, not a fresh-every-run output. Confirmed by reading every writer:
# run_pipeline.py, apex_quality_field_backfill.py, cve_id_backfill.py,
# actor_attribution_enricher.py, generate_advisory_pdfs.py and
# threat_graph_engine.py all read-then-patch this same file in place, and
# every one of those steps in sentinel-blogger.yml runs between this
# workflow's "Download Intel State from R2" step and its "Upload Intel State
# to R2 (final, post-enrichment)" step -- so no wiring change is needed
# there, only this entry. It has no pre-existing R2 key of its own (r2_upload.py
# and r2-data-sync.yml only ever touch data/stix/feed_manifest.json), so its
# key mirrors its local path, same convention as feed_state.json /
# processed_intel.json above. This file is also independently subject to the
# exact same P0 push-rejection root cause this script fixes for the other
# three (it is in safe_git_commit.py's CRITICAL file list) -- its
# generated_at was frozen at the same 2026-08-26 incident date before this

    # in that window are PR merges), and data/ai_predictions/ + data/ai/ have
    # only ever been changed by PR #388 and #389 themselves -- never by a

    #
    # sector_history.json is the one that makes this urgent rather than
    # cosmetic: it is genuinely bidirectional cross-run state (the accumulated
    # daily observation series the forecast is fitted on). Without durable
    # persistence it can never accumulate past a single run, so
    # sector_forecast_model.py's 35-observed-day threshold is unreachable and
    # the forecast declines forever. The other three are single-run outputs
    # that a DIFFERENT workflow consumes: ai_brain_publisher.py runs inside
    # sentinel-blogger.yml and reads all three, so they must survive the
    # hand-off between workflows, which only R2 now does.
    #
    # DELIBERATELY NOT ADDED (each costs ops on every sync pass):

    #   data/ai_predictions/apex_forecast_latest.json -- its producer
    #     (agent/v30_apex/predictive_cortex.py) is orphaned, so the object

    # Same root cause as every entry above: genesis-powerhouse.yml and

    # data/{nexus,cortex,quantum,sovereign,genesis}/ was 2026-09-03
    # (75d3027e2), 7 days of "successful" runs producing nothing durable.
    #
    # A second, independent bug compounded this: MANIFEST_PATH
    # (data/stix/feed_manifest.json) is gitignored and neither workflow ever
    # populated it from R2, so _entries() returned [] every run regardless
    # of the push failure -- see the new "download BEFORE engines run" step
    # this mission adds to both workflows, reusing this same STATE_FILES
    # entry (the pre-existing "data/stix/feed_manifest.json" row above) via
    # `--only data/stix/feed_manifest.json`. Confirmed live via
    # scripts/p0_r2_stix_manifest_diagnostic.py (run 34493014038,
    # 2026-09-10T15:03Z): R2's intel/feed_manifest.json is a valid 39-record
    # flat-list manifest, last_modified ~1h before that check -- kept fresh
    # by sentinel-blogger.yml's own existing STAGE 3.5 upload, needing no
    # new producer, only a new (read-only, from this workflow pair's
    # perspective) consumer.
    #
    # Scope, decided per-file (not per-directory) against real consumers,
    # traced by an exhaustive producer/consumer forensic pass:
    #   - The 5 files below are exactly index.html's initEngineLoader()
    #     ENGINE_URLS set for these engines (nexus/cortex/quantum/sovereign/
    #     genesis) -- the customer-facing dashboard's own current-state read.
    #     Each engine's *_output.json is a same-run aggregate of that
    #     engine's own sub-computations (confirmed: none of the sub-files
    #     read their own or another sub-file's PRIOR run output), so only
    #     the aggregate needs cross-workflow-run persistence.
    #   - data/cortex/stream_events.json is CORTEX's one sub-file with a
    #     real consumer beyond its own aggregate: agent/sdk/cdb_apex_streamer.py
    #     treats it as "the live predictive event bus."
    #   - data/genesis/detection_pack.json is GENESIS's one sub-file with a
    #     real consumer beyond its own aggregate: agent/product_factory/
    #     detection_pack_builder.py packages it into a sellable detection ZIP.
    #

    #   data/sovereign/tenants.json -- holds customer-shaped API-key values
    #     (SEC-2026-07-25/2026-08-28 incidents); already excluded from every
    #     git commit this workflow makes and MUST NEVER be persisted to R2
    #     either (see tests/test_r2_state_migration_wiring.py's dedicated
    #     assertion against this exact key ever entering STATE_FILES).
    #   data/sovereign/{mrr_report,invoices,stripe_config}.json -- billing-
    #     adjacent state with a pre-existing, independent duplicate-writer
    #     (scripts/stripe_webhook.py writes mrr_report.json from real Stripe
    #     events on its own trigger). Migrating sovereign_engine.py's
    #     fake-tenant recompute of these to R2 would propagate that
    #     collision into R2 rather than resolve it -- a billing-architecture
    #     decision (CLAUDE.md: payment logic frozen unless explicitly in
    #     scope) out of bounds for this intelligence-persistence mission.
    #     Not read by any customer intelligence panel this mission targets

    internal shapes, and hand-encoding each one's exact schema here would be
    both a maintenance burden and a second, competing source of truth for
    a contract each file's own real consumer (true_intel_ingestor.py,
    run_pipeline.py, intel_persistence_engine.py, ...) already enforces by
    construction. What every one of them agrees on, unconditionally, is that
    a bare scalar is never a valid top-level value -- so that's the one
    invariant checked here, closing the "valid JSON, wrong shape" gap

    Populate each local state path from its R2-authoritative copy.

    `only`, when given, restricts processing to STATE_FILES/STATE_DIRS rows
    whose local_rel is in the set -- e.g. a workflow that only ever reads
    data/stix/feed_manifest.json has no reason to pay for (or wait on) a
    LIST+download pass over the unrelated advisories directory sync or the
    other 18 unrelated state files this module also tracks. `None` (the
    default) preserves this function's original all-rows behavior exactly,
    so every pre-existing caller (ai-predictions.yml, multi-source-intel.yml,
    sentinel-blogger.yml, dashboard-feeds-sync.yml,
    report-generator-regression-gate.yml) is unaffected.

    Three-way outcome per file, per s3_get()'s contract:
      OK        -> local path now holds the R2 copy.
      NOT_FOUND -> one-time bootstrap: leave whatever's already on disk (the
                   current git-checkout copy, on the first run after this
                   migration lands) in place if present; if nothing is on
                   disk either (a genuinely brand-new environment), that's
                   fine too -- the downstream consumer (true_intel_ingestor.py
                   / run_pipeline.py) already handles a missing/absent file
                   as "start empty", which is what a real first-ever run is.
      ERROR     -> hard fail immediately. Silently proceeding as if this were
                   NOT_FOUND would risk the downstream consumer treating a
                   transient R2 outage as "nothing has ever been seen before",
                   discarding real dedup history and reintroducing duplicates
                   into the customer-facing feed.

    PRODUCTION-VERIFICATION HARDENING (2026-09-02): s3_get() writes directly
    to its destination path, so validating local_path in place (as this
    function used to) meant a malformed or wrong-shape download had already
    overwritten a good local copy by the time validation ran -- the ERROR
    log line and had_error=True were accurate, but the damage to the file
    on disk was already done, and nothing here restored it. Downloads now
    go to a `.tmp` sibling first, validated, and only promoted onto
    local_path via an atomic replace on success -- mirroring the write-tmp/
    verify/replace pattern true_intel_ingestor.py's own _save_manifest()
    already uses for several of these same files on the write side. A
    failed validation now leaves whatever was already at local_path
    (git-checkout copy or a prior successful download) untouched, and is
    reported the same way a NOT_FOUND-with-no-local-copy case already was.

    R2 has no cross-object transactions (see this module's docstring's
    Concurrency note), so a run where some of STATE_FILES' 4 uploads succeed
    and others exhaust their retries leaves R2 in a genuinely MIXED state --
    e.g. a freshly-uploaded data/stix/feed_manifest.json paired with a

    instead this function tracks succeeded vs. failed files explicitly so a
