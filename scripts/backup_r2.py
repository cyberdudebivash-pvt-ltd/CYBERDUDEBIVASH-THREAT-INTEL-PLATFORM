CYBERDUDEBIVASH(R) SENTINEL APEX - Cloudflare R2 Bucket Backup

Syncs R2 bucket content to a daily backup manifest with SHA-256 checksums.

P0 R2 COST INCIDENT FIX (2026-09): this was a SECOND, independent full-bucket
amplifier alongside scripts/r2_upload.py's whole-corpus sync (see
docs/P0_R2_COST_CONTAINMENT.md). Confirmed live: this script ran DAILY
(automated-backup.yml, cron 0 1 * * *, its own concurrency group -- not
serialized against sentinel-blogger.yml) and unconditionally GET+SHA256'd
EVERY object in BOTH sentinel-apex-data and sentinel-apex-reports, no
sampling, no bound (~278,790 GETs/day at incident-time object counts).
Two fixes, both evidence-based, not just "reduce the number":
  1. sentinel-apex-reports removed from SOURCE_BUCKETS entirely. Its content
     is now bounded to a 24h rolling window and fully regenerable from the
     core intelligence manifest (scripts/generate_intel_reports.py) --
     backing it up is not needed, and daily-verifying the (formerly ~193K,
     now historical) object corpus is exactly the "historical verification
     scan against sentinel-apex-reports" the cost-containment hardening
     explicitly prohibits in normal operation, independent of retention
     window. sentinel-apex-data (genuine irreplaceable state: dedup
     history, manifests, KV snapshots) remains backed up.
  2. Per-object GET+SHA256 verification is bounded to a rotating sample
     (MAX_BACKUP_VERIFY_OBJECTS_PER_RUN per run) rather than 100% of the
     bucket every day -- see verify_sample_indices()'s docstring for the
     coverage-over-time guarantee this still provides. Objects outside
     this run's sample are still catalogued in the manifest (key/size/etag
     from the LIST response, which is already paid for) with sha256 left
     unset, not silently dropped.

Env vars required:
  CF_R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID     - R2 S3-compatible access key
  CF_R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY - R2 S3-compatible secret key
  CF_R2_ENDPOINT          - https://<account_id>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com

Optional:
  CF_R2_BACKUP_BUCKET             - secondary backup bucket (if set, copies verified objects there)
  BACKUP_MANIFEST_PREFIX          - R2 key prefix for manifests (default: r2-backups/)
  MAX_BACKUP_VERIFY_OBJECTS_PER_RUN - per-run GET+SHA256 verification cap (default: 2000)
