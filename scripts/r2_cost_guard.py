CYBERDUDEBIVASH(R) SENTINEL APEX -- R2 Operation Cost Guard (P0 COST INCIDENT)
================================================================================
INCIDENT: Cloudflare R2 billed 3,004,147 Class A operations in one cycle
($18 pre-tax). Root cause (see docs/P0_R2_COST_CONTAINMENT.md): scripts/
r2_upload.py ran `aws s3 sync reports/ -> s3://sentinel-apex-reports/reports/`
on every scheduled pipeline run (3x/day + push-triggered) against a local
reports/ tree that scripts/generate_intel_reports.py regenerated in FULL
(entire historical manifest, no time filter) every run -- and every
regenerated file embeds a live minute-granularity timestamp into its SIGMA/
YARA/KQL/SPL blocks, so its content differs from the prior run's copy even
when the underlying intel item never changed. `aws s3 sync` therefore
re-uploaded (and, to build its comparison map, LISTed) essentially the
entire ~193K-object historical corpus every single run.

PURPOSE: single, shared source of truth (Constitution Principle 3) for
R2 operation accounting across every script that mutates R2 in the normal
scheduled pipeline (scripts/r2_upload.py, scripts/r2_report_publisher.py).
Two responsibilities:

  1. FAIL-CLOSED BUDGET ENFORCEMENT -- a caller builds its full operation
     plan (how many PUT/DELETE/LIST/COPY it INTENDS to issue) before
     issuing a single one, then calls enforce_budget(). If any ceiling is
     exceeded, enforce_budget() raises R2BudgetExceeded and the caller
     MUST abort before performing any R2 mutation. There is no
     warning-only mode and no continue-on-error path here -- a caller
     that catches R2BudgetExceeded and proceeds anyway is violating this
     module's contract.

  2. OBSERVABILITY -- emit_summary() prints the R2_COST_GUARD telemetry
     block (fixed format, grep-able in CI logs), writes
     data/quality/r2_cost_guard_report.json (this platform's standard
     data/quality/*.json certification-report convention), and appends a
     Markdown summary to $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY when running in Actions.

BILLING NOTE (accuracy, not a "fake cost estimate"): Cloudflare R2 bills
PutObject / ListObjects / CopyObject / multipart operations as Class A.
DeleteObject is NOT billed as a Class A operation on R2 (Cloudflare's
documented pricing explicitly does not charge for deletes, unlike LIST/PUT)
-- so `estimated_class_a` intentionally excludes `delete` from the sum.
Delete count is still tracked, reported, and budget-capped (Phase 8 /
MAX_REPORT_DELETIONS_PER_RUN) for blast-radius safety, not for cost.
