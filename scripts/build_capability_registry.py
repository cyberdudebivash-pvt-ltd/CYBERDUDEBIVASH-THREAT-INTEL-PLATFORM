"""Generates data/quality/frontend_capability_registry.json.

Build script for data/quality/frontend_capability_registry.json, the
canonical frontend capability registry (CLAUDE.md Section 3 / mission item 3
of the sentinel-apex-transformation-8x3y26 session).

Not a CI-invoked script -- scripts/capability_registry_gate.py (added
alongside this file) is what CI runs against the JSON this writes; this
generator is kept in the repo so a future classification pass can
regenerate the mechanical baseline (dynamic vs. allowlisted-static, pulled
fresh from frontend_api_coverage_report.json) instead of hand-editing JSON,
then extend the CLASSIFICATIONS dict below for any newly-added page before
re-running.
